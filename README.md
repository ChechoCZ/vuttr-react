## VUTTR - Very Useful Things to Remember

This is a react app that lists tools and allow You to add new tools, remove a tool, filter by tool or by tags associated to that tool.

Clone this repo, cd in the project folder and run:
```
yarn install
```
This will install all the dependencies. To start the app run:
```
npm start
```

p.s: I will provide the link to the API later.
